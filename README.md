# HackUCI-HelpFun
## Inspiration

Let's inspire laughter and bring joy to the world by creating a social media platform specifically for people to share their funniest memes and jokes. We want to give everyone a break from the stresses of daily life and encourage them to embrace their playful side. Whether it's through hosting joke contests or just simply sharing a funny meme, our goal is to create a community where people can come together to find humor and joy in everyday moments

## What it does

Our app allows users to capture and share hilarious moments with their friends and the world. They can easily take photos, turn them into memes and post them to their social media account. With the ability to create a personalized account, users can like, comment and interact with other users' posts. Additionally, our built-in meme generator empowers users to add creative captions and jokes to their photos, making it a one-stop-shop for all things funny. Join the fun, share a laugh and create lasting memories with our app!

## How we built it

Our team of two set out to build a full stack website using the latest technology. For the frontend, we chose to use the React Js framework, and for the backend, we opted to use the MongoDB database along with the Express framework. To ensure the success of our project, we implemented a well-planned and organized approach. We divided the tasks between us and communicated regularly to ensure that everyone was on the same page. Through this process, we were able to streamline our workflow and ensure that everything was running smoothly. In the end, our hard work and dedication paid off, and we were able to build a full-featured, robust website that met our expectations and requirements. The experience we gained from building this website has taught us a great deal about web development and the importance of teamwork and effective communication in a development project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We successfully implemented a RESTful API that seamlessly integrates multiple models and implements user authentication through the creation of secure cookies. This achievement demonstrates our team's expertise in API development and our commitment to delivering secure, high-performance solutions for our clients.

What we learned

In this project, we were tasked with building a full stack website within a limited timeframe and with a limited team size. Despite not fully meeting our initial expectations, we gained valuable experience and had a great time working together. Through this project, we learned the importance of effective communication, efficient time management, and creative problem-solving in order to complete a complex project in a challenging environment. Additionally, we honed our technical skills and expanded our knowledge of web development. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that taught us not only about web development but also about teamwork and the joy of building something together.
